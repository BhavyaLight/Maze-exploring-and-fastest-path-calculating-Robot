# Maze-exploring-and-fastest-path-calculating-Robot

The project (NTU academic project) is  to design and implement an intelligent robotic system that 
can autonomously explore and traverse the arena without running into the walls or obstacles, then 
find the optimal fastest path from start to goal based on the information received during exploration. 
The robotic system also need be able to transmit telemetry and receive control signals from a mobile device.

The robot system comprises with Robot Hardware/Arduino (Body), 
Algorithm running on computer (Brain), Android Application running on Nexus 7 Tablet (Commander
to tell the robot to “do exploration”, “do fastest path” and etc) and Raspberry Pi (Nervous System 
to handle the communication among Arduino, Algorithm and Android).
